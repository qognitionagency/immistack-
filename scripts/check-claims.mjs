// Fails the build if a claim the product cannot back appears in source.
//
// The backing product (meru-core, see /api-json) has NO SOC 2, ISO 27001,
// trust accounting, commission tracking, Xero/LEAP/QuickBooks integration,
// live VEVO/DHA/Home Office/IRCC connectivity (all eight regulator adapters
// are sandbox), named customers, or testimonials. This site once advertised
// every one of those — and emitted the VEVO claim into Google rich results
// as FAQ JSON-LD. A regulated buyer's job is to check; one caught claim ends
// the deal. So the check runs in CI, not in a reviewer's head.
//
// Comments are NOT exempt on purpose: a comment saying "we removed the SOC 2
// claim" is fine, but a commented-out claim is one uncomment from shipping.
// Document the removal in git history, not in the file.
//
// ONE escape hatch, deliberately narrow. Saying "we hold no SOC 2 certification"
// is the opposite of claiming one, and a security page that cannot say so is worse
// than one that can. So a line is exempt only if the line IMMEDIATELY BEFORE it
// carries `claims-ok:` plus a reason:
//
//     {/* claims-ok: explicit negative disclosure, not a claim */}
//     <p>Immistack holds no SOC 2 report and no ISO 27001 certification today.</p>
//
// Deliberately not automatic negation-detection — "no SOC 2 gaps" would sail
// through that. A human writes the marker, it shows up in the diff, and every use
// is counted and printed below so the exemptions cannot grow in silence.
