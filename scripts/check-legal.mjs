// The failure mode this prevents is specific. A privacy policy that says
// "operated by null (ABN null)" still reads, to a visitor and to a regulator,
// as a document somebody published. It is worse than no page, because it looks
// like a commitment was made and then got the details wrong. The five fields
// are facts only the operator holds, so the honest options are "filled" or
// "not published" — never "published with holes".
//
// Sibling of check-claims.mjs and wired into the same `build` script, for the
// same reason: the check runs in CI, not in a reviewer's head.
