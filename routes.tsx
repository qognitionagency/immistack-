// These render as FAQPage JSON-LD, so they reach Google rich results. A claim

    // exists, and there is no self-serve path to either: `RESEND_API_KEY` is
    // unset so an invite never arrives, and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is unset so
    // `/billing/checkout` answers 503.
    answer:
      'Not yet — there is no self-serve trial. You can join the early-access waitlist, and we will walk you through the product directly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which countries does Immistack support?',

      'Immistack is built for immigration and migration practices across Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Regulator integrations for all four are sandbox today, with production wiring pending accreditation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I change plans as my firm grows?',
    // Was "Plans scale by team size", which contradicts per-registered-agent
    // billing stated on the same page — support staff seats are free.

  {
    question: 'Does Immistack automate immigration forms?',
    // Was an unqualified "Yes. Client and case data flows into immigration
    // forms automatically." BUSINESS.md §1 names that "the one claim to stop
    // making now", and §2 puts AI form pre-fill under "not safe to claim".
    // What actually ships is PDF generation from config-pack templates —
    // real, but narrower than the sentence it replaced. Departmental forms
    // (956, 956A) are not generated at all.
    answer:
      'Partly. Immistack generates documents from your firm’s own templates with case data merged in — cost agreements today, more as templates are added. It does not yet fill Department of Home Affairs forms such as 956 or 956A, and it does not lodge on your behalf.',
