  // ── /affiliate is UNREGISTERED, deliberately ────────────────────────────
  // The page advertised a 30% lifetime revenue share, a 90-day cookie, a
  // real-time partner dashboard and monthly payouts. Three problems, any one
  // of which is disqualifying:
  //
  // 1. NOTHING IS BUILT. `affiliate`, `partner`, `commission`, `s.34` and
  //    `conflict of interest` all return zero matches across `meru-core/src`
  //    and `packages/`. There is no ledger, no attribution, no payout.
  // 2. NO s.34 ARTIFACT. The audience is registered migration agents, whose
  //    Code of Conduct s.34 makes commission disclosure TWO-SIDED: written
  //    notice to the client AND a written statement back from them. An
  //    *actual* conflict cannot be cured by consent at all (s.34(4)), and it
  //    extends to relatives (s.34(5)). The page carried no conflict language.
  // 3. THE RATE WAS THE CEILING. BUSINESS.md §6.1 sets ~25% as the line that
  //    keeps the conflict merely *potential*, and reserves 30% for partners
  //    with 25+ active referrals. 30% was published as the entry rate.
  //
  // `check:claims` did not catch it: the pattern only covered tracking.
  //
  // `pages/Affiliate.tsx` and `components/AffiliateForm.tsx` were deleted
  // rather than left unreachable — the gate says remove, do not soften, and
  // git history keeps them. Rebuild from history when the ledger and the s.34
  // artifact exist AND the rate is agreed. Note the old title and description
  // put the figure into search results, not just onto the page.
