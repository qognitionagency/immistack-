                Artificial Intelligence is no longer a buzzword in the immigration sector—it is a competitive necessity. Early adopters are seeing dramatic reductions in administrative overhead and refusal rates.

                In our latest survey of 500 migration agents, we found that firms using AI-driven document analysis tools reported a 30% drop in Request for Information (RFI) notices from the Department of Home Affairs. Why? Because the AI catches missing or blurry documents before the application is even lodged.

             <p className="mb-6">
                The goal of any migration agent is the "decision-ready" application. Historically, achieving this required hours of meticulous manual checking. Human error is inevitable. Fatigue sets in.

                Immistack's AI Engine doesn't get tired. It cross-references the client's passport expiry date against the visa subclass requirements instantly. It scans police checks for relevant convictions. It highlights gaps in address history that would otherwise trigger a Section 56 request.

                We are moving towards predictive analytics. Based on historical data, the system will soon be able to give a "Success Probability Score" for each case before it is lodged, allowing agents to manage client expectations with data-backed confidence.
